title: "Two Forms of Pre-rendering"

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.

```js
import { parseISO, format } from "date-fns";

export default function Date({ dateString }) {
  const date = parseISO(dateString);
  return <time dateTime={dateString}>{format(date, "LLLL d, yyyy")}</time>;
}
```
